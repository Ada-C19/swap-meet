# -------- WAVE 2 -------------
#Each item in item class should have an attribute named id
#This attribute is a unique int
#use python's uuid package to help generate numbers without duplicates
#find which one of uuid's functions creates large unique numbers used as identifiers
# these functions will return uuid objects **(not int)** 
# uuid objects have an attribute int which allows us ti access their value as an int
#when we intitialize and instance of items, we can optionally pass in an int with the keyword argument id to manually set the Items's id
#Each item will have a function mamed get_category
#Funciton will return a string holding the name of the class
#instances of vendor have an instance method get_by_id
